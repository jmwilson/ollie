Voice control for Keysight 1000-X oscilloscopes using Snips

Ollie is a voice control assistant for Keysight 1000-X oscilloscopes. Frequently I would be probing a board with both hands and wished I could just yell at the scope to pause the capture. Keysight does offer voice control for its oscilloscopes â€” starting on the 6000 series. For those of us on a more modest budget, a Raspberry Pi and the [Snips](https://snips.ai) platform can be an excellent substitute. Using your voice, you can control the oscilloscope to do:

- run/stop/single capture: "run", "stop", "single"
- show/hide channels: "show channel two", "hide the external trigger", "show reference one"
- adjust vertical/horizontal scale: "set the time base to 100 nanoseconds", "set channel one vertical scale to 2 volts"
- add and clear measurements: "show me the frequency for channel one"
    - duty cycle
    - rise/fall time
    - pre/overshoot
    - +/- pulse width
    - frequency
    - period
    - amplitude/average/min/max/base/top/P-P voltage
- set trigger source and slope: "trigger on the external trigger", "trigger on the falling edge"
- save screen captures to a USB drive: "take a screen shot"

(full command training set is viewable on the snips console link below)

## Getting started

Things you'll need:
- Raspberry Pi model 3A+ or 3B+
- Respeaker 2 Pi Hat
- microSD card (4 GB)

Pre-made images are available for the Raspberry Pi. These images include a base Raspbian lite image, with all drivers, Snips, and the Ollie assistant installed. Connect the Pi to a 1000-X scope and it's ready to go! The image is generated using a fork of pi-gen (https://github.com/jmwilson/pi-gen-ollie).

[Instructions for flashing a Raspbian image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)

This image does not have Wifi or SSH enabled. To enable network and remote access, it is necessary to connect a monitor and keyboard and login through the console. The default username/password is `pi/raspberry`; it is recommended to change this if you are enabling ssh. 

Manual installation steps:
1. Install Raspbian lite
2. Install Seeedstudio drivers for the Respeaker 2: http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/
3. Install Snips for Raspberry Pi: https://docs.snips.ai/articles/raspberrypi/manual-setup
4. Create an assistant on the Snips console that uses the Oscilloscope control app: https://console.snips.ai/store/en/skill_E3eq8QB0Ae. Train the assistant and download the .zip image, and expand it under `/usr/share/snips`. 
5. Install the ollie code on the Raspberry Pi, and run using `python <path-to-ollie>`
